# COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

## üìä Overview
This project is a data-driven visualization of COVID-19 trends, built using **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and **SQL** for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
The goal of this project is to showcase key insights into COVID-19 cases and deaths across different regions.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Developed interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Data Source**: Kaggle.

## üìÇ Dataset
- **COVID-19 Case Data**: Daily reported cases and deaths by country.
- **Population Data**: To calculate key metrics like infection rates and vaccination coverage.

## üìà Key Insights & Visualizations

## üìå SQL Queries Used
Some of the SQL queries used in this project include:
```sql
-- --Total cases vs Total deaths

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM Covid_deaths
ORDER BY 1,2;

--Likelihood of contracting covid in United States
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
ORDER BY 1,2;

--Percentage of population that got covid
SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
ORDER BY 1,2;

--Countries with the highest infection rate compared to population

SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionRate, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM Covid_deaths
--WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC;


--Countries with the highest death count per population

SELECT location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;



-- By continent
---Continents with highest death count per population

 SELECT continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;


-- Global Numbers


SELECT date, SUM(new_cases) AS TotalCases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT)) AS TotalDeaths, 
SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT))/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1,2;


SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS TotalCases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT)) AS TotalDeaths, 
SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT))/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM Covid_deaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2;

```

## üöÄ Power BI Dashboard Features
- **Dynamic Filters**: Users can filter data by country, date range, and case status.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Line charts, bar charts, and maps for easy data exploration.
- **Key Metrics**: Total cases, new cases, deaths and infection rate.


## üèÜ Key Takeaways
- SQL is a powerful tool for handling large datasets and performing data analysis.
- Power BI enables effective storytelling through interactive visualizations.
- Understanding COVID-19 trends through data analysis helps in making informed decisions.
